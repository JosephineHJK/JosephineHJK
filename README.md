Project description

It was difficult to find a great idea for an application, and even harder to find someone how needed an app, especially one that was within the reach of my competences. Then I had a chat with my younger brother who is a football fan, he told me that him and his friends often play apps together in their spare time. They like to compete, and a football quiz would be great. The timing of a football app could reach even more football fans because the FIFA World Cup that is currently being held in Qatar.
